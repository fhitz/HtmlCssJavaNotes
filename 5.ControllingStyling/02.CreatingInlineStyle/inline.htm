<!-- Tips:
		So inline styles are styles that are written directly inline in your HTML. And they're applied usually to a single element. So in this case, for the H2. If I open it up and apply a style attribute, I can now write any CSS formatting that I want.

		So this is using HTML syntax, meaning its an attribute of an HTML element, but now I'm going to pass in CSS properties and values. So you still have to sort of understand CSS in order to write inline styles. You have to know which properties and which values can be applied to different elements. In this case, I'm going to change the color of the H2. So in between the quotation marks, I'm going to type in color and we don't use equals when we're assigning values in CSS. We use a colon. So color colon, and then red check the sample at the bottom.
