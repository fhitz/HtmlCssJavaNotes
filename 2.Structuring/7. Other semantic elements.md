      <h3> Conveying meaning through structure </h3>
      <p>Creating properly structured pages is the foundation of any good website. A solid semantic structure allows you to convey meaning and properly represent content types through nothing more than the page's markup. This, in turn, makes your content more accessible, easier to index and search, and makes it easier to repurpose. Remember that there are a lot of different devices, robots, and other user agents that will be reading your code. <em>Without a consistent, semantic structure your site will be less effective.</em> </p>
  </header>
    <h3>Sectioning elements </h3>
    <p>One way to add meaning to your content is to organize them into sections that convey meaning and structure. For example it's pretty standard to contain introductory information within a section, page navigation within its own area, the page's main content in its own region, and related information within a sidebar. HTML contains numerous elements that are designed to assist in the logical structuring and semantics of page content. </p>
    <p>In previous versions of HTML creating new sections of content was done almost exclusively through the use of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements" title="heading elements"><b>heading</b></a> tags, with <b>divs</b> being used to group areas of content together. <b>Class</b> or <b>ID</b> attributes would allow designers to attach more semantic meaning to the groups, although this meant little to most user agents. In HTML5 new sectioning and semantic elements were introduced to help represent commonly used sections and create more consistent page structures. Tags like the <b>aside</b>, <b>article</b>, <b>footer</b>, <b>header</b>, <b>main</b>, <b>nav</b>, and <b>section</b> allow authors to identify common page regions and convey more semantic meaning. </p>
    <p>Although some of these elements are very specific, in many cases which element you'll use and how you'll structure them is very much a judgment call. Make sure, however, that your finished structure represents the desired document outline. </p>

    <h3>Document outlines </h3>
    <p>One of the fundamental concepts of HTML is that its documents can be represented by a document outline that summarizes the content of the page. Imagine a page being represented by a table of contents and you'll have a good idea of what one of these outlines might look like. These outlines assist in tasks such as quickly searching documents and making content easier to navigate for assistive devices. </p>
    <p>Prior to HTML5, document outlines were generated entirely through the use of headings. An H1 at the top of the page would serve to identify the page content, and subsequent headings would create sections and subsections inside of it. This meant that having a strategy for when to use certain headings was critical for maintaining consistent document structure. In HTML5 a new outline algorithm was introduced that added the new sectioning elements to the heading elements and created a more sophisticated outlining model. Although not currently implemented by user agents it is still recommended that authors familiarize themselves with it so that they're using the new sectioning and semantic tags properly. </p>
    <p>It is still considered to be a best practice to use heading tags to establish the document outline. Mozilla has a fantastic article on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document" title="Mozilla Dev article on HTML sections">sections and outlines</a> in HTML documents that I strongly recommend reading.</p>

      <h4>W3C Warning</h4>
      <p>At the time of the authoring of this course, the W3C had posted this warning regarding the HTML5 outline algorithm:</p>
      <blockquote>There are currently no known implementations of the outline algorithm in graphical browsers or assistive technology user agents, although the algorithm is implemented in other software such as conformance checkers. Therefore the outline algorithm cannot be relied upon to convey document structure to users. Authors are advised to use heading rank (h1-h6) to convey document structure.</blockquote>

    <h3>WAI-ARIA Roles</h3>
    <p>Carefully structuring an HTML page is the first step into ensuring that the content is accessible to all users. You should also use WAI-ARIA role attributes where appropriate to increase accessibility and improve semantics. WAI-ARIA is short for the Web Accessibility Initiative's Accessible Rich Internet Application specification. The roles attribute attempts to identify content and its capabilities by assigning it to a predefined role. This helps assistive devices understand what the content is, how it relates to other content, and how the content can be interacted with. The W3C has a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-aria-in-html-20140626/" title="Using WAI-ARIA in HTML">fantastic resource</a> on how WAI-ARIA works and how it should be used with HTML.</p>

      <!-- There's been a lot of conventions developed around the use of <footers>. They do typically appear at the bottom of content. Most pages do have a footer that contains extra links and navigation or information in it. So think about how people have already established the way that footers are used on the page and sort of begin your strategy there. Now the last element that I want to talk about with you guys is one that's a fairly recent addition to HTML. And that is the main element. The main element represents the main content of the body of a document or application.  

     So, this one is actually a pretty easy one to wrap your <head> around. And if I think about this particular page, our <main> content is definitely the <article>. So, what I'm going to do, is all the way around the article. I'm not going to replace the article, because I need the article. For its semantic struggling abilities I'm just going to take the main tag and I'm going to wrap it all the way around the article. No you may think of that as a little bit overkill. Do you really need to go to that amount of trouble in structuring your content? Well, my take on this a really wonderful thing to do in terms of assistive Devices. People that use string readers, search engines, robots that are scanning your copy.

     It is semantically rich, and it's going to help your site be more successful in terms of its organization and overall semantic information. So I highly recommend using the main element in that capacity now if I say this. And preview this in the browser, I don't see anything different at all on the page. That's because the changes that we made were all semantic they are not visual. We also haven't effected the document outline at all but we have added a great deal of semantic meaning to our content. To be sure you understand exactly how headers and footers work as there are a lot of authors out there that seem confused as to when to use them.
     
     And whether or not you can have multiples of them on the page, that sort of thing. I also highly recommend using the main element when it's appropriate as it can greatly enhance the accessibility of your pages. -->
